              In today's society, with the increasing awareness of energy conservation, emission reduction and environmental protection and the introduction of relevant laws and regulations, the development of new energy vehicles is showing vitality. At the same time, the issue of automobile lightweight has also attracted more and more attention along with the popular use of vehicle power batteries, because only under the premise of ensuring safety and reliability and appropriately reducing the weight of the automobile can it be possible to save energy, reduce emissions and reduce emissions. The purpose of further protecting the environment. In fact, in order to save energy and reduce energy consumption, the topic of automobile lightweight in foreign countries has been proposed as early as the 1950s. The application of aluminum alloy materials and glass fiber composite materials opened the way for the initial implementation of automobile lightweight. With the advent of high-strength, high-temperature-resistant automotive carbon fiber composite materials, which have more weight reduction and other performance advantages than aluminum alloy materials and glass fibers, since the 1970s, the lightweight of civil vehicles has been selected. New directions and new actions.

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<strong>1. Examples of the application of carbon fiber composite materials in the automotive industry </strong> 
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<br />
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
The use of automotive carbon fiber composite materials in foreign countries to promote automotive lightweight technology started in the 1970s. After more than 40 years of development, significant results have been achieved. Represented by developed countries in the automobile industry such as Europe, America and Japan, relying on the production of mature automobile carbon fiber precursors, resins and other raw materials, as well as supporting oxidative carbonization and thermoplastic molding technologies, first of all, some... For the purpose of energy saving, emission reduction and personalized design, we actively use automotive carbon fiber composite materials to promote lightweight vehicles, and strive to reduce production costs through rational use of materials, improved processes, shortened processing cycles, and appropriate mass production. For example, General Motors of the United States exhibited in 1992 an ultra-light concept car with a car body made of carbon fiber composite materials. The body mass was 191.0 kg, the vehicle mass was reduced by 68%, and the fuel saving effect reached 40%. The 1999-2004 Mustang truck produced by Ford Motor Company also adopted a carbon fiber composite transmission shaft, which simplified the original two components and merged them into one transmission shaft. Compared with steel materials, the weight can be reduced by 60% to 70%. In addition, the engine hoods of Ford and Porsche cars in the United States have also adopted automotive carbon fiber composite materials, which have achieved significant lightweight effects without reducing safety. German BMW announced in 2008 that it had adopted automotive carbon fiber composite materials as one of the mainstream materials for general-purpose automotive applications. In 2011, BMW released the i3 electric concept car and i8 plug-in hybrid concept sports car designed with lightweight technology at the Frankfurt Auto Show; in 2014, BMW mass-produced the carbon fiber i3 pure electric car and i8 plug-in The hybrid sports car is officially launched globally, and the price is equivalent to that of metal materials, which is an important step for the commercialization and popularization of automotive carbon fiber products in the field of general-purpose vehicles.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	Compared with foreign countries, the domestic research and development of using automobile carbon fiber composite materials to promote automobile lightweight started relatively late, and all aspects are still in the exploratory stage, but some breakthroughs have been made. For example, the Composite Materials Teaching and Research Office of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics began to study the RTM process that is closely related to the production of automotive carbon fiber composite materials in 1993. Through the introduction of RTM injection molding equipment, dozens of civilian RTM molds have been successfully developed, including: composite 130 truck door outer panels, composite 2020SY jeep hard top, Beijing JEEP Cherokee rear lift door, Jetta car rear wing, and a new generation of large Hongqi front-end board, agricultural machinery seedling throwing tray, etc. In 2013, Beihang University, Beijing Nashengtong Co., Ltd. and other units jointly researched and developed a high-performance long-car carbon fiber reinforced nylon composite car wheel, which reduces the weight by more than 60% compared with the same type of aluminum wheel. On January 20, 2015, my country’s first automotive carbon fiber new energy vehicle with independent intellectual property rights of core technology officially rolled off the production line at the factory of Jiangsu Yancheng Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. The car was used in domestic production vehicles. The full carbon fiber composite material passenger compartment design can reduce weight by 50% compared to similar car bodies, giving the vehicle power battery weight and space.

<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<strong>2. Analysis of application difficulties</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
  Although automotive carbon fiber composite materials have broad prospects in automotive lightweight applications, analysis of the current domestic industry situation shows that whether it is raw material production, automotive carbon fiber processing technology compatibility and quality stability, or composite material molding technology and application **Compared with the level, there is still a big gap, and the high cost and other factors also severely restrict its R&D, promotion and application in the automotive industry. Based on the analysis of existing domestic basic conditions, there are mainly the following application difficulties.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
  1. Insufficient concentration of professional talents and industry research and development forces
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	From the overall analysis, the limited R&D capabilities and experimental conditions are the prominent restrictive factors affecting the popularization and application of carbon fiber composite materials in domestic automobile lightweight. The domestic carbon fiber field.... Professor Xu Lianghua, deputy dean of the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, summed up the development status of the domestic industry with "good results but hidden dangers". He pointed out that the current automotive carbon fiber composite material industry has problems such as insufficient technical background and blindly following projects. Most products do not have market competitiveness and lack professional and systematic research and development in specific application areas. From the overall level of the country, although many key technologies have been mastered, since no industrial strategic innovation alliance or R&D platform has been formed, these key technologies are scattered in various fields and links, and R&D resources cannot be effectively integrated and allocated, resulting in strength Decentralized, the overall level of the industry will not rise.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	2. There is a gap in the supply of raw materials supporting mass production
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
  At present, there are more than 30 domestic automobile carbon fiber manufacturers, each with an investment ranging from several hundred million yuan to more than one billion yuan. The large-scale production capacity does not exceed 3,000 tons. Due to weak industrial technology, it is difficult to convert production capacity into output. The actual annual output of domestic automotive carbon fiber is only 4,000 tons, and most of these more than 30 companies produce small tow products, and there is no large tow automotive carbon fiber production technology and products. Although it has been reported recently that Shanghai Jinshan Petrochemical has broken through the key technology of large tow carbon fiber production, its production capacity is only 300 tons per year. For new energy electric vehicles, large-tow carbon fiber has low cost, high fabric utilization efficiency, and few plies, which can meet the rhythm of mass production. If the output of new energy vehicles can reach 5 million in 2020, the lightweight of vehicles still needs enough large-tow automotive carbon fiber products as support. Therefore, large-tow high-strength automotive carbon fibers for automobiles have not yet been mass-produced, which is a fundamental factor affecting the promotion and application of automotive carbon fiber composite materials in the automotive industry.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	3. Design, R&D and production technology capabilities are not yet complete
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	Compared with the international level, there is a significant gap in the design and development of domestic automotive carbon fiber composite materials. Since the automotive carbon fiber composite material is a "composite" of materials and structures, it increases the design freedom at the macro, micro, and meso scale levels. However, the material forming and the structure forming must be completed at the same time. Therefore, calculation and analysis are included. The design of carbon fiber composite materials, such as experimental verification, is very important. The design of carbon fiber composite materials for foreign automobiles has been standardized and mature, but there is a big gap in this aspect in China. At present, there is a lack of proprietary design analysis software and material performance database in China, as well as design experience and related design standards. The use of automotive carbon fiber composite materials for some automotive load-bearing components needs to learn from foreign automotive design specifications, and there is currently a lack of carbon fiber in China. Test methods for composite body, aluminum alloy frame and vehicle performance. In addition, the automatic processing technology of the domestic automotive carbon fiber composite material industry, such as automatic silk laying technology and integrated molding technology of components, is relatively backward, low production efficiency, and special equipment depends on imports. These restrict the application of carbon fiber composite materials in automobiles. Important reason. Automobile production has the characteristics of large volume and wide range, and it has high requirements for cost and production efficiency. In the total cost of automotive carbon fiber composite parts, the material cost only accounts for about 20%, while the manufacturing cost accounts for 70% to 80%. Although the existing composite material technology can be used in the automotive industry in principle, the cost is considered At present, low-cost rapid prototyping methods (such as RTM, hot-pressing outside the tank, filament winding molding and pultrusion molding, etc.) of carbon fiber composite materials for foreign vehicles have become the focus of research and development, while the development of low-cost molding technology for domestic composite materials It started late, the technical level is low, and the product variety and industrial scale need to be improved. For some key molding technologies (such as RTM and high-pressure RTM, high-efficiency molding processes such as hot-press molding outside the tank), there is still a big gap between my country and developed countries and regions such as Europe and the United States.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	4. The complete vehicle tooling design cannot keep up
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	The automobile lightweight technology first emphasizes the lightweight of the whole vehicle. It needs to achieve two aspects: one is to use low-density and high-performance materials in the material, and to make it; the second is to coordinate the structural design Do it well, the smaller the relevant parts, the better, and the thinner the better. After these two requirements are fulfilled, in addition to reducing weight, the vehicle must also ensure comfort and safety, so the performance optimization design of the vehicle must be carried out. In addition, from the analysis of assembly technology, there is a process of transformation from welding to welding and bonding in automobile lightweight chemical equipment, and the matching must be redesigned. In addition, the difficulties in the design and application of the whole vehicle include: Because the characteristics of automotive carbon fiber composite materials are anisotropic, they will show different material properties in different directions of the x, y, and z axes. The parameters of the stiffness of the test object need to be calculated. The three directions are equivalent to three times the design workload. In addition, because the resin material is affected by light radiation, high temperature and low temperature, acid and alkalinity, etc., it will cause aging and affect the service life. Choose carefully. Carbon fiber composite monocoque car bodies also have problems such as complex structural design, high molding accuracy requirements, and deformation or partial damage that can hardly be repaired.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	5. Material recycling and reuse is quite difficult
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
  The composition of automobile carbon fiber is somewhat similar to graphite, and the stability is similar to that of graphite, so carbon fiber composite materials cannot be degraded in nature and can only be recycled. Although the world’s most advanced countries are actively researching the recycling technology of automotive carbon fiber composite materials, and many technologies have been born, such as the crushing backfill method, the incineration energy recovery method, and the fiber separation method, but none of them is beneficial to environmental protection. A mature case of large-scale recycling.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<strong>3. Countermeasures</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	First of all, it is necessary to establish and improve the industry technology innovation development strategic alliance for the R&D and application of carbon fiber composite materials for "production, study, research and application" with the automobile manufacturing industry as the end user, gather professional talents and technical resources, form R&D advantages, and establish R&D bases. It is necessary to realize that the application and promotion of carbon fiber composite materials in automotive lightweighting is a multi-disciplinary and multi-industry cross-border integration, which requires the participation and interaction of textile, chemical, automobile manufacturing and other industries and their respective expertise. It is necessary to take new energy electric vehicles as the main application object, start with a certain component of a specific brand and model of automobile, deploy all forces, and implement a series of operations in R&D and mass production. At the same time, it can also carry out vehicle applications. We will strive to make breakthroughs from point to point to promote substantive applications in the industry. On April 26, 2018, the China Carbon Fiber Composite Materials Application Technology Alliance held its inaugural meeting in Beijing. The alliance gathered the superior resources of the domestic carbon fiber industry chain. Through the top-level design, the resources were further integrated, and the public service functions were improved. The starting point of the work, the formation of a mechanism for co-promoting and sharing innovation results, and becoming a collaborative innovation platform in the industry chain for the end application of carbon fiber composite materials, which is conducive to promoting the healthy and sustainable development of the domestic high-performance carbon fiber composite material industry. This will help solve the difficult problems of the application of carbon composite materials for vehicles
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	Secondly, it is necessary to manufacture low-cost new car carbon fiber, overcome the complexity, time-consuming and labor-intensive deficiencies of the original manual layup, try to shorten the molding time, CFRP parts processing, assembly and connection, CFRP integrated molding design, modular and integrated We will keep abreast of the new research and development directions and innovation achievements of foreign countries, such as chemical manufacturing, and recycling of automotive carbon fiber composite materials, and continuously improve and perfect the existing domestic automotive carbon fiber composite material (CFRP) production technology and equipment. For example, the American multinational company Dow Chemical "steamed and baked" carbonized polyethylene and other fibers in an anaerobic state to prepare low-cost polyolefin carbon fibers with a high carbonization rate of 35%, reducing the cost by less than 1/2 ($11/kg). At the same time, avoid the discharge of a large amount of extremely toxic waste gas; Japanese Toray company adopts high and ultra-high molecular weight mixed polymer, and uses the temperature-induced and force-induced variable gelation spinning method to spin the innovative technology, which increases the spinning speed by more than a hundred times. High-strength (over T-1000) high-modulus (over M-50) low-cost PANCF precursor yarn. German BMW and SGL have jointly developed epoxy resins with a curing time of 2 minutes and 5 minutes, and use HP-RTM technology with a pressure of up to 2900psi (203kg/cm2) and an injection rate of 200g/s to optimize the resin system, Process and mold design, the correct combination of RTM process, to achieve the "one minute cycle" high-pressure resin transfer molding technology. The University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom utilizes the dissolving power of supercritical fluids and uses a cheap solvent system to dissolve the epoxy resin in CFRP, which can separate a single form of carbon fiber with almost 100% retention of performance. The above-mentioned new foreign R&D directions and innovation results are worthy of attention and reference from domestic counterparts.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
Third, it is necessary to reduce production costs as the main research and development goal, so that the cost of automotive carbon fiber composite materials is close to or even lower than the original cost of metal parts processing and production. First, it is necessary to concentrate scientific research on technical and quality research. While introducing, digesting and absorbing foreign technology, strengthen independent R&D and production capacity of large tow carbon fiber suitable for automobile lightweight, overcome international trade barriers, and strive to reduce prices. From 14-30 US dollars/kg to about 10 US dollars/kg, it provides fiber raw material support for the manufacture of high-performance, low-cost automotive carbon fiber composite materials for vehicles. It is reported that based on the development needs of the "low-cost, large tow, and industrial-grade" carbon fiber industry, a large-scale large tow carbon fiber infrastructure project with an annual output of 12,000 tons has started in Jilin Chemical Fiber Group. After the project is put into production, it will fill the gap in the production of large-tow carbon fiber in my country, and provide insights for the application of automotive carbon fiber composites in automotive lightweighting; the second is to increase the research and development of low-cost automotive carbon fiber composites integrated molding technology Strength, including the improvement of RTM and high-pressure RTM, hot press molding outside the tank, pultrusion molding, filament winding molding and other molding technologies. On the premise of ensuring quality, shorten the production cycle of automotive carbon fiber composite products and reduce energy consumption. Similar to the pre-oxidation treatment, microwave carbonization technology, low temperature and low pressure molding technology, electron beam rapid curing, and the development of high-strength rapid curing resin materials, they are all worthy of attention, research and development and application; the third is related to the mechanization and automated manufacturing of automotive carbon fiber composite materials. At the same time as the equipment is being introduced, we will pay attention to the renewal and localization of research and development, and improve the large-scale production capacity on the premise of reducing the cost of equipment application.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	Fourth, we must take the automotive industry as the leader to form an automotive carbon fiber composite material R&D and manufacturing industry chain and industry clusters. According to the needs of end users, establish an automotive carbon fiber composite design and application system with universities and scientific research institutes as the fulcrum and active participation of related industries and enterprises. From fiber manufacturing to automotive assembly use, expand production scale and improve production Ability to realize mass production of supporting facilities. It is necessary to strengthen the technical reserves in the field of automotive carbon fiber composite material design, learn and learn from the design and production experience of foreign countries, study new concepts and new methods for the optimal design of automotive carbon fiber composite materials, develop or introduce relevant design analysis software, and establish Automobile carbon fiber composite material performance database, establish and improve related design standards and specifications, develop an intelligent design and verification system that combines advanced computer simulation methods with database technology, and provide technical support for the application of carbon fiber composite materials in automobiles . Particular attention should be paid to the research and development of supporting finishing technology and special tooling methods, as well as the excavation of effective material recycling technology.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<br />
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	Fifth, we must focus on financial investment in the development and production of automotive carbon fiber composite materials. Carbon fiber composite materials are multi-disciplinary and multi-technology integrated high-tech products. They have outstanding development and application expertise in the automotive industry. They require high equipment supporting requirements and require a large amount of upfront financial investment, whether it is large tow carbon fiber manufacturing, rapid curing molding technology, and The improvement of vehicle design and tooling technology requires a large amount of capital injection. Therefore, relevant production companies must seek financial support from the government on the one hand, and at the same time, they must also do a good job of risk analysis and financial budget to implement the financial investment of the project. Provide a reliable basis and effective**.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<br />
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong> 
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	<br />
</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">
	In view of the excellent performance of automotive carbon fiber composite materials, as well as the development background of energy saving, emission reduction and environmental protection, the application demand for automotive lightweight will continue to grow in the future, and the competent government departments should play the role of overall planning and deployment and centralized regulation. , To strengthen the mutual cooperation between scientific research institutions, raw material manufacturers, molding processors, and final product equipment manufacturers to form a consortium to jointly promote the sustainable development of carbon fiber composite materials in automotive lightweight applications. Relevant industries and enterprises should also enhance their sense of innovation and initiative, actively face existing problems and "shortcomings" with an attitude of "overcoming difficulties", and take corresponding measures to improve them. It is believed that the promotion of lightweight carbon fiber composite materials in automobiles There are bound to be new breakthroughs and new developments in applications.
